Your not supposed to be here, but if you did end up coming here for some strange reason, i gotta little something for you. i have the files you can add that will give you import media and voice files, save starters, the old voices (ivona 2, neospeech, cepstral etc) and also the old preview screens and video list, it comes with much more then that, there is the link to it. https://bit.ly/3fnD2hN
